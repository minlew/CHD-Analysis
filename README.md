# Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Analysis

## Project Description

The goal of the project is to create a logistic regression model for predicting whether someone has CHD [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea).

Dataset content:
* age: The age of the participant in years.
* education: The level of education of the participant, represented as a numeric value.
* sex: The gender of the participant (M for Male, F for Female).
* is_smoking: Indicates whether the participant is a smoker (YES) or non-smoker (NO).
* cigsPerDay: The average number of cigarettes smoked per day by the participant.
* BPMeds: Indicates whether the participant is on blood pressure medication (1) or not (0).
* prevalentStroke: Indicates whether the participant has previously had a stroke (1) or not (0).
* prevalentHyp: Indicates whether the participant has hypertension (1) or not (0).
* diabetes: Indicates whether the participant has diabetes (1) or not (0).
* totChol: The total cholesterol level of the participant.
* sysBP: The systolic blood pressure of the participant.
* diaBP: The diastolic blood pressure of the participant.
* BMI: The Body Mass Index of the participant.
* heartRate: The heart rate of the participant.
* glucose: The glucose level of the participant.
* TenYearCHD: The target variable indicating whether the participant developed coronary heart disease within 10 years (1) or not (0).
